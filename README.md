# React_Hooks

1. #### `What are React Hooks`
    it's a React way to allowing you to attach reusable logic to an existing component.
    ##### Before hooks the most common way to attach logic externally to a component was to use the `Render Props` or `Higher Order Components(HOCs)` pattern. these methods were complex and harder to follow.

    ##### React Hooks solve this problem by creating a mechanism for you to extract code that we can use between components. and it's all done without any unneccessary nesting in our component tree.
    1. ##### React hooks allow attaching reusable logic to an existing component.
    2. ##### React hooks are JavaScript functions that allow developers to use State and Lifecycle  methods inside react functional components

this way we can develop applications without using JavaScript classes.and we don't have to worry about the keyword `This` anymore.

    1. UseState
    2. UseRef
    3. UseEffect
